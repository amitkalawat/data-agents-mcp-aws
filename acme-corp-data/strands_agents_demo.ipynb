    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect to MCP Servers**: Initialize connections to multiple data sources\n",
    "2. **Create Specialized Agents**: Build agents with specific roles and expertise\n",
    "3. **Perform Complex Analyses**: Use natural language to query and analyze data\n",
    "4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive insights\n",
    "5. **Generate Business Intelligence**: Create executive-ready reports and recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Interface**: Query data using plain English\n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding**: Agents understand business context and objectives\n",
    "- **Cross-Functional Analysis**: Combine data from multiple sources seamlessly\n",
    "- **Actionable Insights**: Get specific recommendations, not just data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the MCP servers with more sophisticated analytics tools\n",
    "2. Create more specialized agents for specific business functions\n",
    "3. Build automated reporting workflows\n",
    "4. Integrate with real-time data streams for live monitoring\n",
    "5. Add visualization capabilities to the agents"
