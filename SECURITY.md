# Security Policy

## Overview

This repository contains demo/experimental code for data streaming and analytics. While it follows security best practices, it is not intended for production use without additional security hardening.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or credentials in code
3. **Example Files Only**: Only `.env.example` files with placeholders are committed
4. **Local Services**: MCP servers use stdio transport (not network exposed)
5. **SSL/TLS Support**: Kafka connections configured for SSL

## Security Considerations

### For Development

- Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
- Use the provided `.env.example` files as templates
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Run services locally only

### For Production Use

If adapting this code for production:

1. **Authentication**: Add proper authentication to all services
2. **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control
3. **Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit is encrypted
4. **Secrets Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager or similar
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
7. **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation
8. **Audit Logging**: Log all access and modifications

## Dependency Management

Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Python
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Node.js
npm update
npm audit fix
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. Do NOT create a public issue
2. Email details to: [security@example.com]
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

## AWS MSK Security

When using AWS MSK:

1. Use IAM authentication
2. Enable encryption in transit and at rest
3. Configure security groups properly
4. Use VPC endpoints where possible
5. Enable CloudTrail logging

## Data Protection

- All demo data is synthetic
- No real user data should be used
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations for real data
- Implement data retention policies

## Security Checklist

Before deployment:

- [ ] Remove all `.example` suffixes and add real configs
- [ ] Enable authentication on all services
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and restrict network access
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery
- [ ] Test security configurations
- [ ] Document security procedures
